# Gaussian Elimination in Python
Source code for implementation of Gaussian Elimination in Linear Algebra assignment at HCMUT.
**The question.** Write a program in Python to solve the system of equations using Gaussian elimination. Conclude the number of solution, the exact solution in case of unique solution, the number of free variable in case of infinitely many solutions.

## Installation
You need to install NumPy. The easiest way to install NumPy is by using Pip. Pip a package manager for installing and managing Python software packages.

Install Pip by running:
```
sudo apt install python-pip
```

Install NumPy by running:
```
pip install numpy
```

Verify whether NumPy is now part of you Python packages:
```
pip show numpy
```

## Usage
```
python main.py
```
